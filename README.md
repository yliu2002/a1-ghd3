I created the image shown above with one pink rectange on the upleft corner of the image, one orange circle on the upright corner of the  
image, one small circle on the bottom left of the corner and one polygons on the bottom right of the image. They are seperated by one 
vertical black line and one horizontal black line. Then the top two shapes that are orange circle and pink rectangle swap positions 
horizontally against each other. and the green circle in the bottom left of the screen become bigger and bigger. eventually as show below:
