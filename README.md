I created the image shown above with one pink rectange on the upleft corner of the image, one orange circle on the upright corner of the  
image, one small circle on the bottom left of the corner and one polygons on the bottom right of the image. They are seperated by one 
vertical black line and one horizontal black line. Then the top two shapes that are orange circle and pink rectangle swap positions 
horizontally against each other. and the green circle in the bottom left of the screen become bigger and bigger. eventually as show below:

Section for Technical and Design Achievements:

Here are the technical achievements of the project:
it successfully implemented the swapping of the orange circle and yellow rectangle at the top using D3.js transitions. it also utilized D3.js to create an interactive effect where the bottom left green circle becomes bigger upon mouseover.


Here are the Design Achievements of the project:
I created a visually appealing SVG container with dimensions of 600x600 pixels. I also added lines, rectangles, and a polygon to the SVG container using D3.js. I implemented smooth transitions between states, such as the movement of the orange circle and the resizing of the green circle.
